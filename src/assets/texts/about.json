  "AboutMeDescription": "Hello and welcome on my portfolio website. I'm Peter and I've been learning front end since spring 2017. Through this time I've made some progress, but there are so many things ahead of me. When I began studying Computer Graphic (specialization graphic designer) in 2015, I had been focused on web design skills, which I wanted to improve. Time was passing and I found a new passion - front end. I started to learn HTML, CSS, JS and all those front end things and I'm still learning. I've been looking for work as (junior) front end developer mainly in Rzeszów or Cracow. Check my portfolio, and feel free to contact me.",

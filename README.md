This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Basic info

My portfolio website which I'm trying to create in React. It's maybe overkill, but it's mostly for practice.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

I'm Peter and I've been learning front end since spring 2017. When I began studying Computer Graphic (specialization graphic designer) in 2015, I had been focused on web design skills, which I wanted to improve. Time was passing and I found a new passion - front end. Creating new websites, apps and designs is very exciting despite knowing how much I have to learn yet. I'm looking for work as (junior) front end developer mainly in Rzesz√≥w, but I'm also considering others localizations. Check my portfolio, and feel free to contact me."}}},"contentfulHomeCurrentState":{"title":"Current state","description":{"internal":{"content":"Currently, I'm learning to use React (without Redux) and trying to more understand JavaScript.
